# tearline-DPRK

note: to train the model, you need to have the '64x64_15cm_24px-exc_v5-marg-32_expanded' cars overhead with context dataset in this folder. The label files that the model currently uses are also reformatted to only include Toronto.

The python files associated with this project are lenet.py, tearline_data_loader.py, and train_tearline.py.
